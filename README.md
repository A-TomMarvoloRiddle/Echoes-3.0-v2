- **Build & Deploy:**
	1. Push to `main` branch (or your production branch)
	2. Vercel auto-builds and deploys the app
	3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
	4. Configure custom domain and SSL (optional)
- **Storage:**
	- Audio files (voice journals) will be stored in Vercel Blob, S3, or similar, with DB reference

# üõ°Ô∏è Crisis Safety

- **Crisis Detection:**
	- All journal and roleplay entries are scanned for crisis indicators using AI/ML
	- If a crisis is detected, the user is shown immediate support resources (helplines, chat, etc.)
	- Optionally, a crisis alert can be sent to a configured webhook for escalation
- **Privacy:**
	- Crisis detection runs locally or server-side; no third-party sharing of sensitive data
	- Users can opt out of crisis detection in preferences
- **Immediate Support:**
	- Prominent access to helplines and support resources throughout the app
	- Anonymous guest mode ensures users can seek help without registration
- **Data Retention:**
	- Users can delete their data at any time, including crisis-related records
